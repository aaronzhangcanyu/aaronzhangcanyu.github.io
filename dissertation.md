# My Dissertation

I am working on my master dissertation at the present stage and the research topic is "Clickbait Detection and Exploration on WeChat Articles". [Clickbait] (“标题党” in Chinese), is a pejorative term to describe web content in which attractive, exaggerated and misleading titles are deliberately used to lure the audience to click on the links in order to increase commercial revenue. According to the criticism from scholars and pundits, clickbait content is undermining the media credibility to a
great extent, however, the industry is becoming more and more dependent on this enticing means to attract attention.

As a pioneer of the backlash against clickbait, [Facebook] has updated its News Feed twice to reduce clickbait headlines to improve user experience because an initial survey conducted by them earlier showed 80 percent of the time people used headlines to decide whether they click the links or not. Compared to the ubiquity of clickbait, which has already incessantly spread on the web for a long time, the emergence of academic articles on this topic occurs in 2015, about one year after the industry backlash. To the best of my knowledge, there is still no research designed for the clickbait detection on WeChat articles only.

Natural language processing and machine learning technologies will be used to build a detection model to distinguish a clickbait heandline automatically. I have already collected around 18,000 popular WeChat article headlines from 24 different categories and 34 different registered locations of WeChat subscription accounts according to the rank list on [gsdata.cn]. For building the detection model, a small part of the headlines should be labelled as clickbait or non-clickbait, and which needs your contribution on this data annotation task. 

The task has been manipulated on a platform called [Figure Eight].

Your kind help would be significant for my research now and a great motivation for my life in the future.
