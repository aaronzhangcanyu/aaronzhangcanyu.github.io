# Make Contribution

Thanks for making contribution on my research project, “Clickbait Detection and Exploration on WeChat Articles”, which is supervised by Professor [Paul Clough]. This data annotation task is deployed on a crowdsourcing platform called Figure Eight, so you have to sign up for a contributor account first. Please click here <a href="https://tasks.figure-eight.work/users/new" target="_blank"><img src="/images/signupIcon.png" alt align="absmiddle" width="16" height="16"></a> to become a contributor using your email address. When you receive an email for verifying your Figure Eight account, please click on the link to complete the registration process (it is estimated to take around 5 minutes to receive the verifying email). Besides, if you do not want to sign up an account by yourself, you can also contact me to get one directly, that would save you some time.

For protecting your privacy and keeping the ethics stance of this research, an Informed Consent [<img src="/images/img_415489.png" alt align="absmiddle" width="16" height="16">] form has to be read and accepted before starting the annotation task. If you agree to take part in the research project as described, please tick the “I agree” checkbox to continue. You will be presented with 50 headlines and their corresponding links for the original articles in each web page (also called "task"). Review the headline to determine its practice of clickbait, so that I can have a greater understanding about the overall clickbait practice of the WeChat platform. 

The maximum number of the task you can complete is 10, i.e. 500 headlines presented in 10 pages, and you can decide your own task number flexibly according to your personal situation. You can leave jobs at any time, but you will only be credited for the tasks you've completed. If you want to continue the contribution on more tasks another time, just come back to the Informed Consent page, click on the continue botton and sign in your previous Figure Eight account. Enjoy your data annotation journey and have a cup of coffee. It's my treat if you want, many thanks!


 
***PS:*** *The data annotation task has finished now. Thanks for your contribution! If you have any problems with your annotation data, please feel free to contact me by czhang67@sheffield.ac.uk.*
