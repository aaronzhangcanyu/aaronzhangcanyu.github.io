# Make Contribution

Thanks for making contribution on my research, “Clickbait Detection and Exploration on WeChat Articles”, which is supervised by Professor [Paul Clough]. This data annotation task is deployed on a crowdsourcing platform called Figure Eight, so you have to sign up for a contributor account first. Please click here <a href="https://tasks.figure-eight.work/users/new" target="_blank"><img src="/images/signupIcon.png" alt align="absmiddle" width="16" height="16"></a> to become a contributor using your email address.

For protecting your privacy and keeping the ethics stance of this research, an Informed Consent [<img src="/images/img_415489.png" alt align="absmiddle" width="16" height="16">] form has to be read and accepted before starting the annotation task.
