# Make Contribution

Thanks for making contribution on my research project, “Clickbait Detection and Exploration on WeChat Articles”, which is supervised by Professor [Paul Clough]. This data annotation task is deployed on a crowdsourcing platform called Figure Eight, so you have to sign up for a contributor account first. Please click here <a href="https://tasks.figure-eight.work/users/new" target="_blank"><img src="/images/signupIcon.png" alt align="absmiddle" width="16" height="16"></a> to become a contributor using your email address.

For protecting your privacy and keeping the ethics stance of this research, an Informed Consent [<img src="/images/img_415489.png" alt align="absmiddle" width="16" height="16">] form has to be read and accepted before starting the annotation task. If you agree to take part in the research project as described, please tick the “I agree” checkbox to continue. You will be presented with 300 WeChat article headlines and their corresponding links for the original articles. Review the headline to determine its practice of clickbait, so that I can have a greater understanding about the overall clickbait practice of the WeChat platform. Enjoy your data annotation journey and have a cup of coffee. Thanks!
