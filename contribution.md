# Make Contribution

Thanks for making contribution on my research, “Clickbait Detection and Exploration on WeChat Articles”, which is supervised by Professor [Paul Clough]. This data annotation task is deployed on a crowdsourcing platform called Figure Eight, so you have to sign up for a contributor account first.
