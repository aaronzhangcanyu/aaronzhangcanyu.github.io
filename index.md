# About Me

My name is Canyu Zhang (Aaron), a master candidate in [TUOS]. I have a multi-disciplinary background with the
knowledge and experience across information technology and social science. 
I am studying Data Science in [Information School] and my research interests are mainly around computational social science, 
also called social data science, which aims to generate theory-informed predictive models 
and underpin the way we understand and solve social problems. 

My latest finished projects including a trend prediction of Sheffieldâ€™s bicycle thefts, 
a risk factors analysis of late life long-term sleep disorder, 
and a prediction of Titanic survivals based on a competition in [Kaggle]. 
I have already achieved a distinction result for my pre-sessional course 
and an average distinction level for all the lecture modules. At the present stage, 
I am working on my master dissertation and the research topic is 
"Clickbait Detection and Exploration on WeChat Articles".
